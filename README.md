## Experience

**Tester** | TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES (TCS) - Hyderabad, India 
* April 2021 - December 2023
* Worked in testing Manual testing of letters generated by the banking client, gaining knowledge in Manual testing and some automation testing
* Executed manual and automation testing for banking client letter generation, identifying and documenting 120+ defects over a 9-month period using Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, which contributed to a 15% decrease in post-deployment issues.

## Projects worked at TCS

### Banking Application and Database Testing 
* Reviewed assigned user stories, gathered required data, and tested the application to ensure all pages and tabs function as expected. 
* Verified that data is correctly populated in the database as per the specified rows and columns.

### Bank Letter Validation
* Reviewed assigned user stories, triggered scenarios to generate letters, and performed manual testing for template accuracy.
* Validated letter content with NVDA for accessibility, followed by automated and complete testing upon successful checks. 

## Others projects

### ‚û°Ô∏è Chronic Disease & Premature Mortality Analysis using Python programming

* This project analyzes the correlation between chronic diseases and premature mortality across U.S. states using CDC data from 2010‚Äì2023. The analysis identifies demographic and regional disparities influenced by poverty and lack of insurance.

üéØ Objectives
- Analyze trends in chronic disease prevalence.
- Examine demographic disparities in premature mortality.
- Identify high-risk states and regions.
- Correlate poverty and insurance status with death rates.
- Provide visual insights to inform healthcare policy and reform.

**Data Source:** [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators Dataset](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-2023-Release/g4ie-h725)  
**Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
**Modules:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
**Final Report:** Includes data cleaning, visual analysis by state, gender, race, and social factors to inform health policy.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Amazon Selling Workflow Database Project

* This project models the complete workflow of selling products on Amazon through a relational database system. It captures all major processes including product listing by sellers, warehousing, consumer account creation, order placement, shipment tracking, and delivery by carriers. The database is designed using business rules and relationships that reflect real-world Amazon operations.

The project includes five core operational aspects:
1. New product creation by sellers.
2. Product receipt and inventory management in warehouses.
3. Consumer account creation and management.
4. Order placement and popular product tracking.
5. Product shipment and delivery tracking.


### ‚û°Ô∏è Automated Fire Fighting AGV Using Digital Controller 
* This project develops an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) with a PLC to autonomously detect and extinguish fires. It aims to reduce human risk in hazardous environments like factories using various sensors. The system provides an efficient, automated firefighting solution to enhance safety and minimize losses. Key components include a Delta DVP12SA2 PLC and multiple sensors.
  
### ‚û°Ô∏è Pitting Corrosion Behavior of Post-Weld Heat Treated AA7075-T651 Alloy

This project explores the impact of different post-weld heat treatments on the corrosion resistance of AA7075-T651 aluminum alloy welded using Friction Stir Welding (FSW). We examine how treatments like Cyclic Solution Treatment (CST) and T6 artificial aging influence the material's microstructure and resistance to pitting corrosion.
**Data Source:** Experimental data from laboratory tests on AA7075-T651 alloy plates  
**Tools & Equipment:** Dynamic Polarization Test (GILL AC), Optical Microscope  
**Modules Used:** Metallography, Electrochemical Corrosion Analysis  
**Final Report:** Includes polarization plots, microstructure images, and comparative analysis of CST vs T6 treatments
The study supports the development of durable aluminum alloy joints for aerospace and automotive applications by optimizing weld treatment processes.
